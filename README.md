# Immersive Societies [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cansik/immersive-societies.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cansik/immersive-societies)
A world which is filtered by your likes &amp; subscriptions.

## Description
As on facebook, everything you see, here, smell, taste and feel is filtered by the likes and subscriptions. 
You do not have to see gamblers on the street. You do not have to smell ugly cheese in winter. And you do not have to hear people in the crowded train.
The filter blends everything out for you.

But how do you start from a void, because you do not like anything? You derive it from your parents, like your DNA. But it is your filter setting DNA, stored in a large computer system which controls every filter.
